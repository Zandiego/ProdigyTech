Internship

Task 1 (User Management API):
For the first task of the internship, I built a RESTful User Management API using Node.js and Express. The API allows creating, reading, updating, and deleting user records (CRUD operations). I implemented proper project structure with folders like routes, controllers, models, and used tools like Postman to test the endpoints. I also added middleware for error handling and ensured environment variables were managed securely with a .env file.
